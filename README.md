## Description
A command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## User-Story
AS A manager<br>
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info<br>
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML<br>
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address<br>
WHEN I click on the GitHub username<br>
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab<br>
WHEN I start the application<br>
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br>
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br>
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team<br>
WHEN I select the engineer option<br>
